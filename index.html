            Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. The players take on the role of code-maker, and code-breaker.
            The code-maker begins the round by creating a code of length 4-6 from 7 colors with the possibility of duplicates.
            In alternating turns, the code-breaker will make an educated guess about the code-based on their previous guesses,
            and the code-maker will return a response to the player's guess. The code-maker will return a white colored peg
            for each correct color guess in the wrong position, and a red peg for every correct color in the correct position.
            Play continues to alternate this way, until the code-breaker either guesses the correct code, or uses all of
            their available guesses. The code-maker will receive points for the number of turns it took the code-breaker
            to guess their code.
