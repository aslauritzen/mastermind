        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the game grids are tables that are generated with JavaScript. I have nested tables that are styled
                to appear similarly to a traditional mastermind board.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the user's interaction with the game is done through buttons, selects, and clicking on table cells.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    User input in the form of mouse clicks
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is entirely based on mouse clicks, the keyboard is not used in the game.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether the game is starting, or the users reset the game, the boards are generated using the innerHTML property.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can load a sample game, or a 'saved' game by formatting a file titled
                <a href="json/sample_state.json">sample_state.json</a>. Instructions demonstrating the proper formatting of
                this file can be found in the <a href="./readme.txt">readme</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If either the player or computer correctly guesses the code, a congratulatory audio snippet will be played.
            </p>

                <strong>
                    Game logic code

            <p>
                This part was intense, and I will do my best to explain how it all works. The page will begin by presenting
                you with the options to select the number of game rounds, and a code length. Once you select these options,
                You can select whether you want to play a player game or a computer game. If you select the button titled
                load game, it will ignore your selections for rounds and code length, and load what was saved.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Computer Game:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A computer game is a mode where the user selects a code and then the computer will attempt
                            to crack the code set by the user. This will be done by alternating turns where the computer
                            will make a guess and a user will give their response by clicking in the empty table cells on the right.
                            (blanks are allowed and are used to indicate a total miss). Pressing submit response
                            will trigger the computers turn, and it will guess again. Proper responses are crucial
                            in this mode. If the player doesn't respond correctly, the computer will not be able to guess the code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Player Game:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This mode is where the user will attempt to guess the code generated by the computer.
                            The user can set their guess in the middle column by clicking on the pegs. Once their guess is set,
                            they can press the make guess button and the computer will return a response in the right column.
                            Play will continue until either the player guesses the code, or the last round is played.
                            At any point, the user can hover over a blurred field in the top right to see the code.
                        </p>
